# AI-Maze-Runner
For this project, the problem statement is to develop multiple agents that have the capability of traversing through a maze from start to finish. The agents must find a path from the start to the goal node in a grid that is filled with blocked cells and ghosts. The behaviour about how an agent needs to respond to its environment is defined for each agent. Based on this, this project lays out various approaches which help to create the agents with varied degrees of intelligence and accuracy.
